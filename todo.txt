Optimizations:
- Function that returns all locations within sense radius efficiently - probably not possible, should record bytecode use
- Ordering lists of MapLocations by closest
- Bytecode issues with getting nearby MapLocations


General:
- Improve miner exploration code
- Bad building code for miners - just randomly set up stuff, should be around the base
- Shoot down closest drones rather than just random
- Store block stuff in memory so it doesn't have to be constantly called
- Check rc.isReady() stuff in drone - does it work, is it right
- Write functions to determine when to stop building miners/start building stuff
- Improve miner communication for hash determination stuff

- LANDSCAPERS THAT ARE PART OF THE WALL SHOULD HELP MAKE OTHER WALL TILES ACCESSIBLE FOR OTHER LANDSCAPERS

- NEED FUNCTIONS FOR DECIDING WHEN TO BUILD THINGS - tuning is becoming an issue
- Improve drone stuff so it remembers where some flooded tiles are - and communication for those tiles
