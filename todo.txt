Optimizations:
- Function that returns all locations within sense radius efficiently
- Ordering lists of MapLocations by closest
- When searching for things like soup, do a search radiating from the location - should be easy and done without BFS
- Replace some MapLocation in a direction with .add() instead?
- Bytecode issues with first turn HQ viewing


General:
- Better encryption for blockchain stuff
- Writing better pathfinding - very challenging, maybe just writing a drone version of the pathfinding
- Split up functions so it's actually workable
- Clean up dir list vs directions+center
- Improve miner exploration code
- Bad building code for miners - just randomly set up stuff, should be around the base
- Finish water elevation calculation function


- FIX TRYMOVINGTOWARDS right now it just breaks since the increments are just the same tile again
