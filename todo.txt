Optimizations:
- Function that returns all locations within sense radius efficiently - probably not possible, should record bytecode use
- Ordering lists of MapLocations by closest
- When searching for things like soup, do a search radiating from the location - should be easy and done without BFS
- Replace some MapLocation in a direction with .add() instead?
- Bytecode issues with getting nearby MapLocations


General:
- Better encryption for blockchain stuff - hashing being worked on
- Writing better pathfinding - very challenging, maybe just writing a drone version of the pathfinding
- Clean up dir list vs directions+center
- Improve miner exploration code
- Bad building code for miners - just randomly set up stuff, should be around the base
- Finish water elevation calculation function
- CONVERT DRONE CODE TO STATE BASED
- Shoot down closest drones rather than just random
- Store block stuff in memory so it doesn't have to be constantly called
- Check rc.isReady() stuff in drone - does it work, is it right
- Write functions to determine when to stop building miners/start building stuff
- Improve miner communication for hash determination stuff

- NEED FUNCTIONS FOR DECIDING WHEN TO BUILD THINGS - tuning is becoming an issue
