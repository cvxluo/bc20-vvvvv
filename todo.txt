General:
- Bad building code for miners - just randomly set up stuff, should be around the base
- LANDSCAPERS THAT SPAWN AFTER POOR WALL MESSAGE WILL TRY TO LEVEL THE WALL
- NEED CRUNCH CODE
- LANDSCAPERS THAT ARE PART OF THE WALL SHOULD HELP MAKE OTHER WALL TILES ACCESSIBLE FOR OTHER LANDSCAPERS
- NEED FUNCTIONS FOR DECIDING WHEN TO BUILD THINGS - tuning is becoming an issue
- Improve drone stuff so it remembers where some flooded tiles are - and communication for those tiles
