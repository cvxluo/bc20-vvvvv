Optimizations:
- Function that returns all locations within sense radius efficiently
- Ordering lists of MapLocations by closest
- When searching for things like soup, do a search radiating from the location - should be easy and done without BFS


General:
- Better encryption for blockchain stuff
- Writing better pathfinding - very challenging, maybe just writing a drone version of the pathfinding
- Split up functions so it's actually workable
- Clean up dir list vs directions+center
