Optimization:
- maybe refactor MapLocation shape getting into plain arrays to reduce bytecode
- compute partOfDefense for landscapers only once

General:
- Bad building code for miners - just randomly set up stuff, should be around the base
- LANDSCAPERS THAT SPAWN AFTER POOR WALL MESSAGE WILL TRY TO LEVEL THE WALL
- LANDSCAPERS THAT ARE ON THE WALL SHOULD KILL ANY BUILDINGS NEXT TO IT
- NEED CRUNCH CODE
- LANDSCAPERS THAT ARE PART OF THE WALL SHOULD HELP MAKE OTHER WALL TILES ACCESSIBLE FOR OTHER LANDSCAPERS
- Redo defensive spaces calculation
- ON STATE 5 SHOULD EVENLY DO ADJACENT STUFF SO WE DON'T LET FLOODING IN TOO EARLY
- NEED FUNCTIONS FOR DECIDING WHEN TO BUILD THINGS - tuning is becoming an issue
- Improve drone stuff so it remembers where some flooded tiles are - and communication for those tiles
- Rewrite pathing to deal with our own units
- Revise miner building protocols for lattice
