Strategy Ideas:
- Making walls around the HQ
- Sending waves of drones to pick up enemy units and drop them in water
- Net shooter lattice?

- Implement state based thing like last year
- Most movable units can be run on a home-destination frame - they go to the destination, do something, go back home, do something, and repeat

Tunnel strat:
Use landscapers to make a tunnel to the enemy HQ, placing down net guns - no other landscapers could enter to mess it up
Maybe alternate landscapers and net guns in a 3 wide tunnel, so that whenever any dirt is placed on the sides it can be picked up again
Go to the enemy HQ and use a drone to put a landscaper next to it, to bury it

Rush strat:
Build landscaper, grab dirt, rush to enemy base
Wait long enough, then build miner if strat doesn't work


Plan:
Wall around HQ - surrounded by drones, except for one tile?

Counter would be a net shooter built at the base - maybe consider that for offense



To communicate:
- First integer is an identifier
Need to think about how to do it - possible methods:
    - Hash of ID
    - Flat value
    - Flat value but modified each turn - maybe first value is different then hashed?
- Last integer is turn number of robot
- Second integer is ID of robot sending?

Need to indicate what type of message it is, like if a miner finds more soup

Turn 1 communication:
HQ message is composed of
(Should compress, integers can store multiple location values)
    - Flat value
    - Soup Location X1
    - Soup Location Y1
    - HQ Location X2
    - HQ Location Y2
    - garbage
    - HQ ID



Things that should be communicated:
    - Soup locations
    - Enemy HQ locations
    - Flood areas
